      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Scottish artist based in Dundee who loves character design and worldbuilding. I initially studied animation at Dundee and Angus College before graduating Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design with a BDes (Hons) in animation.

I specialise in character design, producing illustrations and storyboarding. All of which fit with my passion for worldbuilding and storytelling through comics, animation and film.

I am proficient and have prior experience working in:

Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Premiere Pro

Adobe After Effects

Clip Studio Paint

TVPaint

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro

Microsoft Office Suite

        Autodesk Maya</p>
